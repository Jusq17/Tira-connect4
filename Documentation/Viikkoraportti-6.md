# Week 6

This week I tidied up some code to make it more readable. I also made changes to the GUI regarding the ending of the game.

The game is playable and the GUI is reaching its final stages. I might change a couple small things but I think it's pretty much done and it works.
The only thing I still want to add to the program are multiple difficulty settings. I will just use the minimax algorithm at different depths.
Also I still need to add some performance tests before the project is over.
