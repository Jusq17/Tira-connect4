# Project definition

The aim of this project is to create an AI that can play connect four using a minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.
The game and AI will be developed using Python3 and the GUI using the pygame library.

## Difficulty settings

There will be two AIs to play against: One with a naive minimax approach and one with minimax and alpha-beta pruning.
These AIs can also be put up against eachother and the more sophisticated one should be victorious most of the time.
