# Week 1

I did not spend any time coding this week. Instead I spent my time choosing a suitable subject. 
I also did some research to gain more knowledge and I chose my subject based on that also.
I think I managed to choose a subject that is interesting to me and also doable without hindering my other courses.
Next week I will start to flesh out the project and make a foundation for the game to be played on.
I might also start to code a naive minimax AI.

Hours spent this week: 2
