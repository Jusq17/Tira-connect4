# Week 7

This week I finished the Gui and added different difficulty settings based on the depth of the minimax algorithm. The first difficulty is "Easy" and only has a depth of 1.
This way beginner players can have an opponent to play against. Because of the low depth the response time in the game is instant. The AI opponent instantly moves on all modern processors.
There are two other difficulties called "Medium" and "Hard". These have a depth of 3 and 5 in the algorithm. The medium opponent responds in less than a second and can be quite
difficult to beat. The Hard opponent responds in less than 10 seconds on modern processors. Because the minimax algorithm has an exponential time complexity the response times can vary from 2-9 seconds on most processors.

Next week I will add more tests and finish the documentation and the project as a whole.
