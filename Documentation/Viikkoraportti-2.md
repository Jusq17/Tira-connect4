# Week 2

This week I started making the layout for the game to be played on.
I also made a naive minimax algorithm that works fairly fast on low depth.(May wary based on hardware)
I made a basic GUI that isn't anything special but works for this project.(needs some updates still)
The game is playable and testable manually but it doesn't function like a proper game yet.
